Hello! My name is Sun Bin MUN, a final year student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology majoring in BSc in Data Science and Technology. I’m also an incoming Technology Analyst in Morgan Stanley Asia Hong Kong.

I still have a long way to learn, and will record my studies, hobbies, and more!

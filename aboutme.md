Hello! My name is Sun Bin MUN. I graduated Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Data Science and Technology. I’m also a full-time Technology Associate in Morgan Stanley Asia Hong Kong in Reliability & Production Engineering for Fixed Income & Commodities, specialized in Foreign Exchange electronic trading engine support.

Academically, my main interest is Data Analysis, Deep Learning, Algorithmic Trading, and Big Data. I also love swimming 🏊🏼‍♂️, golf 🏌🏻, movies 🎥, and traveling 🚅.

I still have a long way to learn, and will record my studies, hobbies, and more!

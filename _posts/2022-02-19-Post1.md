As a data scientist, I always wanted to venture around different topics around the world. Data science is becoming a large portion in the technology, and I decided to go and venture around different technologies on my own. Although I studied Data Science in my university years and obtained a degree, I still believe there is a long way to go. Therefore, I decided to use this space to keep track of my self study, archive meaningful projects I've done, and some thoughts.

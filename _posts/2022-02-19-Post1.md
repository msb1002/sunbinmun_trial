As a data scientist, I always wanted to tackle complex, real life issues with the modern privilege of data abundancy. Data science is becoming a common adaptation to all possible problems around the world, and I decided to go and venture around different technologies on my own. Although I have a Bachelor's degree in Data Science, I still believe it is never enough and there is still a long way to go. Therefore, I decided to use this space to keep track of my self study materials and archive meaningful projects. This page is constantly updated from time to time.

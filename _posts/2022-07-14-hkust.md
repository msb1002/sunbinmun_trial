My Final year project with Professor David Rossiter was about personalizing the algo-trading using Ensemble for multiple models from both the traditional quantitative price prediction approach (TWAP, VWAP, momentum pricing) and machine learning models (SVM, CNN+LSTM, ARIMA/FB Prophet, and Gradient Boosting models). 

Overview of the architecture

# 1. Quantum Computing

More explanations on the IBM official website [website](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing)

# 2. Qiskit

If Quantum Computer is what we can use to break the limitations of traditional "super"computers, Qiskit is the core language (Python based) which can utilize the Quantum circuits provided by IBM Quantum Computer Lab. I will self-study the following topics in particular.

- Introduction
- Machine Learning
- Finance

Further documentation is organized in the following Github repository I made for self studying purposes. [Link](https://github.com/msb1002/qiskit-tutorials)
